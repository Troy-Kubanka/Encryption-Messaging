This is an introductory level C++ encryption program. This was one of the first programs that I created.
This program takes messages to encrypt and allows the user to input the desired key to encrypt the message. 
The menu also allows the user to see all the encrypted messages that are stored, as well as the ability to try to decrypt a selelected message.
User is able to choose what they want, or exit the program, using the menu options 1-4.
